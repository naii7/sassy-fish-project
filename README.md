# _Sassy-me_
## Description
**Sassy-me** is a one-of-a-kind social media. It allow users to rate all type of aspects of their everyday life. From their favorite restaurant's meals, down to the best public restrooms. This application implements both a feed, similar to other social networks', and a personal profile page. The feed shows your best friends' latest post, as well as giving the option to like them. The profile, on the other hand, will show all of your posts. Both can be filtered based on what has been rated (movie, food, concert, etc.)
